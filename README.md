Hello, my name is Zane Hirning and I am an aspiring software developer/any tech developer. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science at Utah State University. My GPA is currently a 3.5, and I was an honors student in highschool with a 3.97 GPA.

In my freetime, I like to code programs and try to learn different languages/skills. I have always had a passion for innovation and learning new things.

I have many skills in different languages, and I am looking to take on an internship/job to broaden the list of things I am capable of, while still supporting myself.

The best way to reach me is via email @ zanehirning41@gmail.com
